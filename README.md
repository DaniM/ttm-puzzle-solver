ttm-puzzle-solver
=================

This is a na√Øve prolog implementation of a solver for the puzzles of the videogame "To the moon" (which is great by the way).
So if you are a little lazy (like me) and don't want to waste your time with the puzzles, which is sometimes a little annoying if you want to see the end of the story, you are free to use it.
The only cons is that you need prolog installed.
